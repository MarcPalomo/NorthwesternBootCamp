Hello. Please find the directory for my Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval HW.

The following files are in this GitHub folder in my HW Repo:

Resources: contains the original csv files and the sqlite files referenced in the code.

Marc_Palomo_Climate_Final.ipynb is the file that contains all of the code for my project 
and should be opened using Jupyter Notebook. There was a discrepency between tasks outlined
in the climate_starter.ipynb file and the ReadMe that explained the assignment. Per Daisy's
comment in our class Slack, I deferred to the ReadMe to complete all necessary tasks, and
completed the first part of the Optional Analyses.

climate_app.py is the file that contains my flask code. I added some brief descriptors when 
outlining all the available routes on the main '/' page in order to clarify the date format 
required to successfully pull the data.
