Hello and thank you for coming to my Geo-Mapping assignment. In this Repo you will find the following files:

config.js
This file contains my Leaflet API referenced in the code in order to display the map.

index.html
This file contains the HTML code to display the page properly. 
The HTML code references the 2 Javascript files and the CSS file.

logic.js
This file contains my code to pull in the earthquake data and visually display the data on the leaflet map.

style.css
This file contains some basic styling in order to display the leaflet map correctly using the HTML code.
