Hello and welcome to my Intro to JavaScript assignment. I had some fun with the formatting but kept the majority
of the original shell css and style.

In this folder of my repository you will find the following files:

index.html - This is the base html code for the mini-site that was created.

The "static" folder contains 3 sub-folders:
css - contains the css code. I only made some minor modifications to the original code that was provided.
images - contains all the original images provided, as well as, the new image I applied to the background.
js - contains the original "data.js" file and the "app.js" file.

The "app.js" file is the primary code feeding into the "index.html" file. Here I made my functions to respond to the
appropriate applied filters. When inspecting the page in the browser, one can see the inputs and the resulting arrays.
Each of the inputs is designed to clear on the click event. If both filters are left blank, there will be a console.log
that says "no data entered".

I hope you enjoy the 3 hyperlinks to music videos found in the carousel at the bottom of the page!
