I spoke with Kerry, and she instructed me to make a ReadMe explaining the files in this folder.

The first file: HeroesOfPymoli_Marc_Final.ipynb is the original .ipynb document with my code. 
The problem I experienced is all of my data frame summary tables were not displaying.

After searching for a solution I then pushed up a second file:
HeroesOfPymoli_Marc_Final_Link_Jupyter_Notebook_Viewer.txt
This file contains the hyperlink that will display the code correctly in Jupyter Notebook without needing to have the source data and opening a Jupyter Notebook on your own computer.
Please copy/paste this hyperlink in the .txt file and it will display my code.

The third file is: HeroesOfPymoli_ObservableTrends_MarcPalomo.docx
This file contains my observable trends as a Word Document.
