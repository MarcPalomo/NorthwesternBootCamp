Hello and welcome to my Tableau HW Repo Folder. In this folder you will find the following files:

Resources- this contains the separated CSV files that are combined and cleaned in order to use in Tableau.
There are 4 Quarterly files for FY19, as well as, 1 file per month July 2018 - June 2019 with trip specific data.
Please note the Quarterly files stops after 6/10; so, I cleaned the Quarterly data to exclude June altogether

Bike_Cleaner.ipynb- this contains the code in Jupyter Notebook where all the CSVs were cleaned and combined into 
the following 2 CSV files that were used in Tableau:

Bike_Data.csv- the file that contains information on rides from 7/1/18-6/30/19
RS_NoJune.csv- the Quarterly data files that has been transformed to show information from 7/1/18-5/31/19

Bike Data.twbx- this is the downloaded version of my Tableau project. To see a Public Published version of this
data set with an brief analysis using the Story feature, you may visit:
