Thank you for looking at my Web Scraping and Document Database Homework. 
This ReadMe explains all the files in this homework folder.

The "Photos" folder contains the pictures of the Mars Website upon submission.
Since I was out of town, I wasn't able to apply as much style to the HTML
code as I would like. I took a picture of how the website looks upon completion;
however, I am going to continue to add little details to the HTML after my
initial upload.

The "templates" folder contains the file called "index2.html". This is the file
that displays the code for the Mars Website.

"app2.py" and "scrape_mars.py" contain the flask code and the scrape code used
to feed the "index2.html" file.

Lastly, the "mission_to_marsFinal.ipynb" contains all the scrape code in a
jupyter notebook file that was used to make sure all the code worked before
adding the data to MongoDB and uploading to my html.
